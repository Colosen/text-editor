How to checkout the latest version from git
In windows prompt type bash (Assuming you have installed git along with git-bash tool)
First step git clone <project URL>
We got the <projecrt URL> from the github webside in the code link

Now all the files from the server (called remote or origin) is downloaded to our local file system. We can see a new project folder created with the same name.

We do
git pull
to pull the latest from the server (remote or origin) to local

We will get a merge conflict if our version is not in sync with server version, and we attempt a commit and push
