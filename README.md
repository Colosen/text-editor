# text-editor
This is a humble text editor program written in Python 3 with the help of the Tkinter module. It consists of a text box and 3 major functionality buttons. The "Save as" button creates a new file as per the user's choice and writes the text in the text box to the file. The "Open" button opens a file as per the user's choice and copies the text of the file onto the text box. When the user opens a file this way, the address of the file is stored. The user can then save the changes made to the file using the "Save" button which overwrites the text in the text box to the file.
